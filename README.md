# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run server`

Runs the json server on 4000 port.

### `npm run socket-server`

Runs the sockets server on 5000 port.

restful and sockets can be on the same port, but in my case I have to use multiple ports due to the lack of my json server config file.

### `npm run start`

Runs the app on 3000 port.
